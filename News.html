                <p> <strong>Bagdad:</strong>The Islamic State (IS) is reportedly trying to exploit the fall of
                    Bashar
                    al-Assad's regime to stage
                    a comeback in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The terror group has started reactivating fighters in
                    Syria and Iraq, with security operatives in both countries, who have been monitoring IS for
                    years,
                    foiling at least a dozen major plots this year, according to a report by Reuters.
                </p>

                <p> The United Nations estimates IS, also known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) or Daesh,
                    has
                    1,500 to 3,000 fighters in the two countries. But, its most active branches are in Africa,
                    according
                    to Search International Terrorist Entities (SITE) data.
                </p>
                <p> The US military believes the group's secretive leader is Abdulqadir Mumin, who heads the Somalia
                    branch, according to an earlier report.
